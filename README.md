Peak Badger is a project that was written at Hack 4 Colorado as part of the National Day for Civic Hacking.  This project won 3rd place in the Open Category.

This repository contains code for the native Android Peak Badger app.  The app allows a user to 'check-in' to a mountain peak anywhere in the world and earn a badge.  As hikers like to preserver battery power or may not have service, this app can run fully in airplane mode.  A list of peaks around the world is stored locally on the device, and the user's current geofenced location is checked against this information.  Badges and peak records are saved on the users device.
